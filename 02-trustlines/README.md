# Create Trustline

This sample project shows how to create a trustline from a user account to an issuer account.

The user trusts the issuer with a specific token and accepts to hold it or make payments with it.

This project is a simple example of what's shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJHAoDPjYi4&t=233s).

## Setup

Run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` will execute the content of `src/index.ts`.
